Revision history for Log-Any

** denotes an incompatible change

0.05  Oct 27, 2009

* Implementation
  - Strip Log::Any down to a relative minimum, so as to keep it stable and
    unchanging. Move everything else to Log::Any::Adapter.

0.04  Sep 3, 2009

* Fixes
  - Replace Test::Deep::cmp_deeply with an internal version to avoid Test::Deep dependency

0.03  Jul 17, 2009

* Improvements
  - Eliminated extra '::Log' from adapter names, e.g. Log::Any::Adapter::Log::Dispatch is
    now Log::Any::Adapter::Dispatch. The long name was properly descriptive but was making
    me wince every time.

0.02  Jul 14, 2009

* Fixes
  - Fix logging aliases like warn => warning

* Implementation
  - Eliminate unnecessary Test/InternalOnly.pm class
  - Precompute alias and method lists like Log::Any->logging_methods
